# SUI-cz

This is a commitizen adapter for the sui-mono tool and any other packages of sui family

This is required to be in a different repo by cz, and the package does not use our `@schibsted` prefix because of how commitizen bootstrap resolves routes.

Is highly inspired in `cz-customizable` adapter. In fact, we would be still using it if commitizen allowed to send configuration in the boostrap.
